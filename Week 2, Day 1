Week 2, Day 1
NOTES re to TICTACTOE:

- write pseudo code
	- when i cllick on a box...
		- it should turn O if it is Os turn, X if it is Xs turn
		(only if box is empty)

- can type div.board and press tab and it creates the right syntax

- "this" means the current thing/object

CSS:
	- for block, 

GIT & GITHUB:

git fetch: goes and fetches new files
git merge: merges new files (be careful, merges can overwrite files)
git pull: does both fetch and merge simultaneously

cloning wih HTTPS prompt credntials to input vs SSH doesn't (just uses your key on computer)

Mercurial is another version of git, does the same thing (aka Hg)
Bitbucket is another option instead of GitHub

Fork vs Clone:

Fork: [avoid for now]
- Fork a repo into own github account
- can't just do a git pull on a repo to update
- allows you to freely experiment with changes
- or use someone else's project as a starting point for your own

Clone:
- Take local copy on your laptop

CLI - Command Line Interface

Js callBacks - Eric led:

Keyword - instanceOf - will be instanceOf Object


function doubler (num) {
    if(typeof num === "number"){
        console.log(num*2)
    }else if(typeof num !== "number"){
        console.log("this is a string")
    }
    
}

doubler("you")

'this' is whatever object you were in most recently.

LAB:

// Write a function generator to make the following code work correctly:
function makeMultiplicator(n) {
    return function(x){
    return x * n;
  }
}


var timesThree = makeMultiplicator(3),
    timesNine = makeMultiplicator(9);

if (timesThree !== undefined && timesThree(12) === 36) {
  console.log('the TimesThree multiplicator works');
}

if (timesNine !== undefined && timesNine(3) === 27) {
  console.log('the timesNine multiplicator works');
}
